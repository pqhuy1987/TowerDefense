Mushroom_Minions
============

Mushroom Minions is a game where you are in control of a hero. Your hero is tasked to defend the land against an assortment of creatures ranging from semi-evil blobs of mud to amphibious, cape-wearing adversaries. Your tools include your trusty towers and your hero-specific abilities. 

You can choose from up to 3 different heroes, each with unique playing styles from your typical warrior to mages and assassins. Heroes gain experience over time and your heroâ€™s abilities can be improved as you gain more experience. In addition, your towers can be upgraded in a number of ways including its accuracy, damage, and chance to critically hit enemies.
