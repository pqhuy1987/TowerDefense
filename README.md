## Setup
 * Fork https://github.com/tastyapp/tookadefense to your own github account.
 * Clone it to your local machine
 * Open it in Xcode and change the `projectRepo` variable in `tookadefense/main.swift` to the current directory
 * Make sure that the project builds (`âŒ˜+R`)

## Informations
This tower defense is a starter project so it's not a complete project. It means that there is just the base of the game and it has to be improved by adding fonctionalities like score-saving, in-app, no-ads, better animations, enemies and towers animation, game recorder and a lot more.
If you find some errors, just contact me via twitter.
I am open to any proposal for improvement.


Enjoy !
